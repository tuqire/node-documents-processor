An example Node data processor. Tries following methods:

1. JSON parser
2. Raw buffer
3. Multiple threads

## How to run

Please make sure you have at least node 10.5.0 to run the server.

Run `yarn` in CLI, then run the following three commands in separate CLI windows.

1. `npm start:client`
2. `npm start:server`
3. `npm start:mock-external-server`

Then, go to `http://localhost:8093/`.
